I recently completed a 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒍-𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒍𝒅 𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒔 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 where I designed and analyzed a 𝑳𝒊𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝑴𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒈𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑺𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎 using SQL. The project involved working with 10,00,000+ 𝒃𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒐𝒘𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒔𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓 7 𝒚𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒔 (2018–2024) 𝒂𝒄𝒓𝒐𝒔𝒔 10 𝒍𝒊𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒔 𝒊𝒏 𝑰𝒏𝒅𝒊𝒂.

    🔹Build a relational database schema to capture library operations (Books, Authors, Members, Branches, Borrowings).

    🔹Write SQL queries to analyze borrowing patterns, overdue behavior, fines, and technology adoption.

    🔹Translate findings into business recommendations for better decision-making.

The schema was structured into 5 key tables:

    1️⃣ Authors – author details

    2️⃣ Books – title, genre, publish year, language
 
    3️⃣ Members – demographics, membership type (Regular/Premium)
 
    4️⃣ Branches – branch details across cities
 
    5️⃣ Borrowings – transactions with borrow date, due date, return date, fines, renewals, and device used.

📊 𝙆𝙚𝙮 𝙄𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙨

    ◾ 𝑩𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒐𝒘𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑩𝒆𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒊𝒐𝒓: Premium members borrowed 2.5x more books than Regular members.

    ◾ 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒅𝒖𝒆 & 𝑭𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒔: ~10% of borrowings were overdue, with an average fine of ₹52.

    ◾ 𝑮𝒆𝒏𝒓𝒆 𝑻𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒅𝒔: Children’s books were most popular, followed by Fiction and Science.

    ◾ 𝑻𝒆𝒄𝒉𝒏𝒐𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒚 𝑨𝒅𝒐𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏: Mobile App usage surged after 2021, accounting for over 35% of borrowings.

    ◾𝑩𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒊𝒔: Metro branches (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru) had higher circulation, while smaller cities saw more overdue returns.

💡 𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨

    ✔️𝑹𝒆𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒆 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒅𝒖𝒆𝒔: Automated SMS/App reminders + fine discounts for prompt returns.

    ✔️𝑶𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒊𝒛𝒆 𝑰𝒏𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒐𝒓𝒚: Expand stock for high-demand genres, maintain balance in low-demand ones.

    ✔️𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒎𝒐𝒕𝒆 𝑫𝒊𝒈𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝑨𝒅𝒐𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏: Highlight Mobile App benefits, add e-book borrowing, repurpose kiosks as self-checkout/search stations.

    ✔️𝑩𝒐𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝑬𝒏𝒈𝒂𝒈𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕: Encourage Regular → Premium upgrades, launch loyalty rewards for on-time returns.

    ✔️𝑩𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉 𝑺𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒈𝒚: Provide seasonal staff support in metros, run awareness drives in smaller cities to reduce overdue behavior.

This project taught me that a BA’s role is more than analyzing data—it’s about 𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒔 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒐 𝒃𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒔 𝒅𝒆𝒄𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔, 𝒂𝒔𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 𝒒𝒖𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒈𝒚. It strengthened my skills in SQL, problem-solving, and communicating actionable recommendations🚀
